    This is a fork of the TWO-TORIAL guides taken from Oct 12th 2025, which were removed from public on December 29th 2025. This repo is provided as-is with contributors anonymized and links to previous project updated or removed. It is provided purely for reference and availability of excellent documentation produced by the previous contributors - it is unlikely that this fork will be updated any further.

!!! warning "This site is by no means all-encompassing"

    **We're only a group of volunteers aiming to bring you the most up-to-date information.**  

    But we're only humans, we make mistakes, and therefore:

    - Please **use a certain degree of caution** while manipulating your game files and **make backups**
    - Don't tamper with things if you don't know what you're doing

    If you can do that, these guides will probably be of use to you.  
    If not, **don't tell us we didn't warn you!**

!!! info "How to use the site?"

    On the left side is a navigation bar containing every guide:

    - **Games** category for game-specific guides on how to setup data, troubleshoot issues, etc.
    - **Error Codes** for a listing of known errors and what to do about them
    - **Game Patching** category for ways to patch/modify your game
    - **Extras** for anything that doesn't fit in the above categories
    - **Other Resources** for links to useful sites such as patchers, external guides, etc.

!!! info "Do you want to help us out?"
